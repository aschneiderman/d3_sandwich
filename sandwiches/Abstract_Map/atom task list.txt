LITTLE TASKS

Here are the little tasks I will use as my canvas for developing the voice commands I need to make Atom run smoothly:
- Cleanup my CSS
- Writing the instructions part of the sandwiches: big picture, maybe the weirdness of the enter business?
-Begin work on the recipe variation where all you do is add a filter to the selected state data







THINGS I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
- being able to jump to the next comma/quote – or delete between two delimiters
- how to navigate to and open files

-beautify scripts?
-How to move around large chunks of text: early in the week: get on the discussion list and ask for advice
