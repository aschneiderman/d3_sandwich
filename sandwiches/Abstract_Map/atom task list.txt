Battle Plan: Atom Task List


When Ben starts working on it,
Stop and learn how to create atom scripts:

ATOM CUSTOM COMMANDS
- Cut/Copy to bookmark
Once that is working:
Command for easily moving recipe step text from Atom to Word
(Precursor: add ending comments to each div tag, so I can search by them)

- Grab everything inside quotes
- Change  Delimeter one so that it includes the tags




ATOM SNIPPETS
- Figure out how to get Atom snippets that actually work properly
Look for examples of Atom snippets, where they are more than one snippet per text/HTML etc.




VOCOLA VOICE COMMANDS
- how to navigate to and open files
- "insert after three underscores"
- Deleting between delimiters, such as the text in a link




ATOM PACKAGES
-beautify scripts?



Eventually, switch to using the following for synchronizing atom across computers:
