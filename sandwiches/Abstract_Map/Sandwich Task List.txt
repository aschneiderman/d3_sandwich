TEXT

abstract map page:
(fix the visual hierarchy of the headers)
"there are plenty of tools to create detailed maps. But what if you want to do something more abstract? Excel/Tableau can't hack it, but D3 can get it done"
or just: "here's something you can't do in Excel/tableau…"


Abstract State Map: the Basic Recipe

Now It's Your Turn…
•           Change which states are selected (here's how)
•           change the color of the normal and selected states (here's how)
if you're not sure how, go back to the recipe steps for ___ and ___and check out the code.


Array:
"a variable won’t cut it, so an array of objects"
(Google JavaScript data types, and to get names right)

Rectangles: (I think)
D3.select("div").style…  .Background color…    .on("click", function());
e.g.: function () {console.log("you clicked a div")});
