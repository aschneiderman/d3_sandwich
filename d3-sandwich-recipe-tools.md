d3-sandwich-recipe-tools

Some of the workflow of creating a recipe is hard to do, but it doesn't require geeking out:
- figure out what concepts/patterns users will have to wrap their heads around in order to make this recipe
- figure out how to break the recipe into chunks, a.k.a. Steps

But some parts of the workflow are pretty geeky – and after, say, you've created your second interactive tool on a recipe Step and have another 2 to go, it can get pretty tedious. That's where d3-sandwich-recipe-tools can help.

# Workflow for Creating an Interactive "Toy"

Most of the time you are going to create one of two types of interactive toys:

- A toy with multiple repetitive values the user can play with – e.g., 5 state's height and width values
