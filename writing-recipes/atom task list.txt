Battle Plan: Atom Task List


VOCOLA VOICE COMMANDS
- some way to insert after HTML parameter -- e.g., given this line:
<div class="toy" id="rectangles_overview">
  be able to pick the second parameter-- e.g., replace parameter 2
  The real question:
    What command names?  Distinguishing between HTML, JavaScript, and Python without having to say a lot each time


- Deleting between delimiters, such as the link text in a URL

ATOM CUSTOM COMMANDS - Capitalizing a word


- how to navigate to and open files

ATOM CUSTOM COMMANDS
ATOM CUSTOM COMMANDS - Convert selection – or entire line? - From underscores to camel case

- Cut/Copy to bookmark
Once that is working:
Command for easily moving recipe step text from Atom to Word
(Precursor: add ending comments to each div tag, so I can search by them)

- Create a "command line"  (need to remember why I need this  :-)

-  Re-factor delete-tags to create a function that lets me operate on the current line
   by passing it an anonymous function
