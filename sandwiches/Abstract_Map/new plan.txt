I need to SLOW DOWN
and create the tools I need
to take care of my hands
(PS: it'll also make creating new recipes easier)

- schedule Monday, September 21 and Tuesday, September 22 mornings to write a draft of Steps 3 and 4

NOTE: I need to PRIORITIZE these additions,
I need to GO SLOW – I will not get it all done by the time Ian is back
what is most important for my being happy and feeling good is to go slow and take care of my hands
- for the steps to create Step 3 and 4, right down my ideal workflow and imagine: what's easy to do, what's hard to do?

High Priority Taking Care Of My Hands
Grabbing the right lines of code
- solution: learn how to do Mark
- create a "select to Mark" and "copy to Mark" commands

Copping another example of code that I'm going to use
- solution: find the division tag, mark it, find the end division tag, and select to Mark

Instead of being afraid of change, right the Python tool/library to make the change easier – and uses opportunity to learn how to write tests
Cleanup/reformat process: if you're going to have to do it anyways, why not
- Do the one-off's on Python
- in D3 Sandwich:  /admin: administrative tools,  /recipe-authors: for making creating recipes easier

One-off changes in Python:
- swap classes, using a high-level domain description: e.g., reorder ([recipe-text, recipe-code], [recipe-code, recipe-text])
- precursor: first check that code is properly tagged with divisions in the right order
- write documentation as I go, OR before I write the code (documentation as spec)


Either in Atom or Python:
Take a form and extract the data
- either singular data or multiple (e.g., row and column)
- extract the IDs and default values

Then, given a template in the clipboard and the selected data,
produce the new input form
- more generally, a "mailmerge" pattern – with test cases and examples
