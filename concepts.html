<h2> Key D3 Sandwich Concepts</h2>  
<br/>
<p>Learning D3 is about:</p>

<p><b>1) Learning some key patterns you'll use over and over</b></p>
<p>Learning D3 isn't about learning a specific command or specific tricks,
it's about learning key patterns
so that when you see code, you don't see individual lines, you see a pattern
(cooking metaphor?)</p>
<p>(And learning patterns in small bites, so you don't get overwhelmed)</p>
<br/>
<p><b>2) Relearning basic high school math – e.g., simple geometry</b></p>
<p>The hardest thing about D3 is that you have to use math to tell it what you want to do.
The math isn't that hard.
The idea is hard, because you don't normally use math to tell a computer where to put things.</p>
