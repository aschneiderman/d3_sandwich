Battle Plan: Atom Task List

* * NOTE: for lots of goodies on / snippets of Atom code, see my Coding folder in Outlook * *

VOCOLA VOICE COMMANDS
- how to navigate to and open files

- Deleting between delimiters, such as the link text in a URL


ATOM CUSTOM COMMANDS
- Convert selection – or entire line? - From underscores to camel case

- Cut/Copy to bookmark
Once that is working:
Command for easily moving recipe step text from Atom to Word
(Precursor: add ending comments to each div tag, so I can search by them)

- Create a "command line"  (need to remember why I need this  :-)

-  Re-factor delete-tags to create a function that lets me operate on the current line
   by passing it an anonymous function




ATOM PACKAGES
-  A linter
-beautify scripts?
