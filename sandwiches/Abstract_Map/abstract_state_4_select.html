      <h2>Recipe: Abstract State Map</h2>
      <h3>Step #2: Add the State Names to the Map</h3>
<p>
All that hard work you put in on Step 2? It's about to start paying dividends. Because Step 3 is just a variation on the pattern you just learned.

  <pre>
var  state_map = [
    { "state": "ME", "row": 0, "col": 10 }</b>,
        { "state": "VT", "row": 1, "col": 9 },
        { "state": "NH", "row": 1, "col": 10 },
        ...

    ];

    // Put the name of each state on its rectangle
    svg_area.selectAll("text")
      .data(state_map)
      .enter()
      .append("text")
        .attr("x", function(d,i)  { return d.col * width + 108;})
        .attr("y", function(d,i) {return d.row * height +  26;})
        .text(function (d) { return d.state; })
        .style("font",   "16px sans-serif")
        .style("fill", "White")
        .style("pointer-events", "none");
</pre>
</div>
</div>  <!-- recipe_row -->

<p> For text, we've got a couple of additional commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>text: the text we are going to put on the map</li>
  <li>font: the text's font</li>
  <li>pointer-events: make it so that if someone clicks on the text, it won't respond like text,
  which can be selected, it'll respond as if it's just part of the rectangle</li>
</ul>

<p>We also use a simple math trick here to solve a problem.</p>

<p> How do we get a state's name roughly centered in its rectangle?
  In a future month, we will learn a fancier trick for doing this: using grouping.
  Grouping is very powerful, but the code looks a little weird when you first see it --
and we think you've already had plenty of weird stuff to deal with.</p>

<p> For now, we will use a quick and dirty trick: if you add __ pixels to the text's
  height and width, it'll be close enough to being centered to be fine for now.</p>

<h2>Taking It out for a Spin</h2>
<p>Before we move on to the next recipe Step, let's play a little with the code.</p>
