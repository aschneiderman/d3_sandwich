<h2> Abstract Maps </h2>
<p>
  There are lots of tools for creating detailed maps. D3 can do that too,
  but it can also create more abstract maps.
</p>
<h3>Abstract State Map</h3>
<p> <a href="abstract_state_overview.html">The Basic Recipe </a></p>
<p>
   Before you try one of the variations below,
   <a href="abstract_state.html">right click this link</a> to download the abstract state map
   and try playing around with it:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Change which states are selected</li>
     <li>Change the color of the selected and normal states</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
     Here is a  <a href="">video</a> on how to make simple tweaks.
   </p>
   <p>If you need a refresher on the techniques of how the states are selected and
     the color of the states is set, check out the  <a href="abstract_st_select.html">recipe
       step</a> on how to do it.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Recipe Variation #1: Scores</h3>
<p>
  In the basic recipe, you just provided a list of which states to select. More often you want to select states based on
  some data, such as a score;  <a href="abstract_state_score.html">this recipe</a>  will show you how.
</p>
<br/>

<h3>Recipe Variation #2: Reading Scores from a File</h3>
<p>
  Most the time, you won't want to embed scores in a data visualization, you'll
  want to read them in from a CSV file from Excel, etc. <a href="abstract_state_csv.html">Here's how</a>.
