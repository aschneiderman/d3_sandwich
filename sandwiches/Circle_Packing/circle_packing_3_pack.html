<h2>Circle Packing</h2>
<h2>Step #3: Generate the Circle Packing Layout</h2>

<p>With the <a href="../Abstract_Map_1/abstract_state_0_recipe.html">Abstract State Map</a>, we told the browser exactly where to put each state's rectangle and text. Although the commands for doing that looked a little weird the first time we saw them, telling it where they should go was pretty straightforward. But what if you want to create a much more complicated data visualization like our Circle packing graph? Trying to do that by hand would be really painful.</p>
<p> Luckily, D3 has some really powerful built-in functions called "layouts" that'll do all the math for you. In this step, we'll learn how to use the one for Circle packing.</p>

<p> What kind of interactive toy does someone need for this step? </p>
