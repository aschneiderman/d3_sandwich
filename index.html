    <h2>Welcome to D3 Sandwich! </h2>
    <p>Want to learn D3.js? Check out these tasty data visualization D3 Sandwich recipes.</p>
    <h3>This Month's Recipes: Abstract Maps</h3>
    <p>The hardest thing about learning D3 is getting started. So for this first month, we're going to start with the simplest types of recipes we could come up with that create interesting visualizations you couldn't easily do in Excel or Tableau: abstract maps.</p>
<p> The Recipes</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="sandwiches/Abstract_Map_1/abstract_state_0_recipe.html">Abstract State Map</a></li>
      <li> <a href="sandwiches/Abstract_Map_1/block_party_0_recipe.html">Block Party Map</a></li>
    </ul>

<p> Techniques</p>
    <ul>

      <li> Fixing Recipe Messes: <a href=""> Debugging</a> (Video)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p> Coming soon: how to make these maps easier to maintain over time, such as updating them using data from a spreadsheet without having to touch the code.</p>

<p>Keep up to date by reading the  <a href="http://datachefs.org/"> Data Chefs blog</a>.
