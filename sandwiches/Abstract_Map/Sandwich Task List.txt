Battle Plan: Sandwich Task List

Cleaning this up:
<td ><input type="text" class="state_input" value="0"  onChange="updateRow('ME', this)"></td>
And while I am doing that, fix the Form so I can have multiple forms and associated svg areas:
Parent element, attar from it, to get svg for a form
How to get this's parent, to get the id of it

- create functions to encapsulate the work I'll do frequently, such as highlighting sample code
Rectangles: (I think)
D3.select("div").style…  .Background color…    .on("click", function());
e.g.: function () {console.log("you clicked a div")});
- For each major semantic div, put a closing comment on the closing div



- creating a code writer .html, which I can use for
creating input forms
Creating  Input form based on selected array of objects
Given an array of objects, create the pre stuff on the side, the input form, etc
