Battle Plan: Sandwich Task List

- Debugging:
do a video I break a couple of things and show the errors
example: if a value is undefined
if the value doesn't exist (e.g., Height instead of height)

Error messages are like crying infant babies with a new parent.
At the beginning, you know it's really upset, you just don't have any idea why.
Over time, as you get to know the baby better you figure out what its particular sounds mean.
The same is true for deciphering error messages.
