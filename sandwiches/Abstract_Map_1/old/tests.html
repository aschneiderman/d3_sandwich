<h3>NOTES</h3>
<p>Not sure where to put the stuff, so dumping it here for now until I have a better home for it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
Troubleshooting:   CSV file: if there is a space before the name of a column, it becomes part of the column's name – at least I think it does.
	When I am ready, ask on Mike Bostock's Google group (do some research first)</li>
<li>

NOTE: need to tell people that to run the CSV file locally without running a server, you need to run it using Firefox: Internet Explorer and Google Chrome consider it a threat, so it won't read the CSV file
