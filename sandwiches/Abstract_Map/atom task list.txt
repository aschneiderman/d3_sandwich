LITTLE TASKS

Here are the little tasks I will use as my canvas for developing the voice commands I need to make Atom run smoothly:
- Cleanup my CSS,
    including adding Google fonts

- I need to stop and explain the concept of an abstract map

- Start with the recipe steps
- Adding the text: have fun with it!
  And take the time to make a list of what navigation/editing commands I want to have

- Create functions to encapsulate stuff I'll do frequently,
  like highlighting the code

- Writing the instructions part of the sandwiches: big picture, maybe the weirdness of the enter business?
-Begin work on the recipe variation where all you do is add a filter to the selected state data



THINGS I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
- delete between two delimiters
- how to navigate to and open files

-beautify scripts?
-How to move around large chunks of text: early in the week: get on the discussion list and ask for advice
