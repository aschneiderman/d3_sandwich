Battle Plan: Sandwich Task List

FIXUP FOR BEN
- Move stuff from the Abstract Maps page to the homepage, and save the info about how to start playing with it
- Add the "knife skills" To the homepage
- Abstract State Map: add a line about what the abstract state map is about  - There are lots of tools for creating detailed maps
- Recipe step #1: Split up the Last step, which is a large block of text right now

CODING
- create functions to encapsulate the work I'll do frequently, such as highlighting sample code

- creating a code writer .html, which I can use for
creating input forms
Creating  Input form based on selected array of objects
Given an array of objects, create the pre stuff on the side, the input form, etc


- Fixing the Form so I can have multiple forms and associated svg areas:
Parent element, attar from it, to get svg for a form
How to get this's parent, to get the id of it

NOTE:
when I get to the point where I am going to work with Ian on the next recipe,
make sure that we end up using "map"



FORMATTING
- For each major semantic div, put a closing comment on the closing div

Array:
"a variable won’t cut it, so an array of objects"
(Google JavaScript data types, and to get names right)

Rectangles: (I think)
D3.select("div").style…  .Background color…    .on("click", function());
e.g.: function () {console.log("you clicked a div")});
